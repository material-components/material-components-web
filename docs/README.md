# Documentation

Welcome to our (very-much-still-in-progress) documentation! As we develop MDC-Web, we will be
adding and amending this documentation such that it is both easy to get you up-and-running, as well as
thorough enough for advanced developers to understand why we made the decisions we did for the
project.

To jump right in and begin using the library, check out our [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started.md)

If you're interested in a general overview of MDC-Web, check out [our developer guide](./developer.md). If
you want to take a deep dive through our architectural overview, jump right into
[architecture](./architecture.md).
